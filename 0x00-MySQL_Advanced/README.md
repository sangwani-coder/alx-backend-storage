# 0x00. MySQL advanced
In this project I will be working backend storage projects using RDBMS(SQL,MySQL).
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data
may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data.

After completing this project I will learn:

- How to create tables with constraints
- How to optimize queries by adding indexes
- What is and how to implement stored procedures and functions in MySQL
- What is and how to implement views in MySQL
- What is and how to implement triggers in MySQL
